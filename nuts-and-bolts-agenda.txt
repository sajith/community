Agenda for the next meeting. Currently scheduled for Tuesday, February 9 18:00 UTC +1

Add items, no need to PR :) just commit!

* What should we do with the tahoe-dev mailing list?

* Should we use a paid CircleCI account? https://circleci.com/pricing/
    If so, please recommend a product.

* Thoughts about a community-run Jitsi instance?
    Do we want this?

* Crafting a structure for the Small Grants program + meeting with the Outcomes Manager at Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp
    Thoughts about the grants program?
  
* https://fosshost.org provides hosted video meetings (using
  BigBlueButton, not Jitsi) for free software projects.  They also can
  host web site and email, but not mailing lists as far as I can
  tell.  Could we apply for an account with them?
